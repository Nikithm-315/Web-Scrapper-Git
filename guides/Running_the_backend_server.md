# Running the Backend Server

To run the backend server, you can use the following commands:

1. **Build the project**:
    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```
    This command compiles the TypeScript code into JavaScript. The output files will be generated in `dist/` folder.

2. **Start the server**:
    ```sh
    npm run start
    ```
    This command runs the compiled JavaScript code using Node.js.

3. **Development mode**:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    This command runs the TypeScript code using `nodemon`, which automatically restarts the server when file changes are detected.

Make sure you have all the necessary dependencies installed before running these commands.
